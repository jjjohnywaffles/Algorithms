    "### Part A: Prove that $n \\geq F_h$, where $F_h$ is the $h^{th}$ Fibonacci number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Height h=0: An AVL tree of height 0 has 1 node (the root itself). The Fibonacci number $F_0 = 1$. Thus, $n = 1 \\geq F_0 = 1$.\n",

    "Height h=1: An AVL tree of height 1 can have 2 nodes (one root and one child). The Fibonacci number $F_1 = 1$. Thus, $n = 2 \\geq F_1 = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inductive Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the property n $\\geq F_h$ holds for all AVL trees of height $\\leq h$. We need to prove it for an AVL tree of height h+1.\n",
    "\n",
    "An AVL tree of height h+1 must have two subtrees; one of height h and the other of at least height h-1 (because the height difference cannot be more than 1 to maintain the AVL property).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the number of nodes in the subtree of height h be $n_h$, and the number of nodes in the subtree of height h-1 be $n_{h-1}$.\n",
    "By the induction hypothesis, $n_h \\geq F_h and n_{h-1} \\geq F_{h-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of nodes n in the tree of height h+1 is $n = n_h + n_{h-1} + 1$, where +1 accounts for the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $n \\geq F_h + F_{h-1} + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is defined as $F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$, so $F_{h+1} = F_h + F_{h-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $n \\geq F_{h+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the induction, proving that for an AVL tree of height h, the number of nodes $n \\geq F_h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B: Showing $h = \\Theta(\\log(n))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $F_k \\geq 1.5^k$ for $k \\geq 30$ and $n \\geq F_h$, we substitute to get $n \\geq 1.5^h$. Taking the logarithm of both sides gives $\\log(n) \\geq \\log(1.5^h) = h\\log(1.5)$. Since $\\log(1.5)$ is a constant, this implies $h = O(\\log(n))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the lower bound, considering the property of AVL trees that they are balanced, and given that $n \\geq F_h$, with $F_h$ growing exponentially as a function of h (Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially), we can also infer that h must grow at least logarithmically with n to keep the tree balanced. Hence, $h = \\Omega(\\log(n))$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The imbalance is caused by the right child of the right child of node 22 (a right-right case). This calls for a Left Rotation to be performed on node 22.\n",

    "The right child of node 22, which is node 29, will come up and take the place of node 22.\n",

    "(A) False Positives and False Negatives in a Bloom Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Bloom Filter, when checking if an element $k$ is in the set, if all $T[h_1(k)], \\ldots, T[h_l(k)]$ are true, we may conclude that $k$ is in the set. However, since Bloom Filters allow for hash collisions, it is possible that these positions in the array were set to TRUE by insertions of different elements (other than $k$). Therefore, the filter may erroneously indicate the presence of $k$ when it was not inserted. This is known as a false positive. On the other hand, a Bloom Filter is designed such that if an element has been inserted, all its corresponding positions in the array will be set to TRUE. Hence, if any of the positions $T[h_1(k)], \\ldots, T[h_l(k)]$ is FALSE, the element $k$ was definitely not inserted, and so Bloom Filters do not produce false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) Probability of a Cell Being FALSE After Insertions\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the hash functions are uniform, the probability that any given hash function does not set a particular cell $T[j]$ to TRUE for a single key is $1 - \\frac{1}{m}$. Since the hash functions are independent, the probability that none of the $n$ keys sets $T[j]$ to TRUE is the product of the probabilities for each individual key not affecting $T[j]$. This can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we have $l$ hash functions, we need to consider the probability that none of the $l$ hash functions will set $T[j]$ to TRUE for each of the $n$ insertions. The probability for each key not setting $T[j]$ to TRUE with any of the hash functions is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^l$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that $T[j]$ is still FALSE after all $n$ keys have been inserted is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^{ln}$\n",
    "\n",
    "(C) Probability of a False Positive\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of a false positive occurs when all $l$ specific cells corresponding to the hash functions for a given key $k$ that was never inserted are TRUE. This can only happen if these cells were set to TRUE by the insertion of other keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that a given cell $T[j]$ is TRUE after all insertions is the complement of the probability that the cell is FALSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "$1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^{ln}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we need all $l$ specific cells to be TRUE for a false positive, we raise this probability to the power of $l$:\n",
