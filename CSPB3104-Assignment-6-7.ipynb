    "In this example, the greedy strategy requires 2 courses, which seems more efficient than the dynamic programming solution at first glance. However, if we consider a scenario where minimizing larger jumps leads to fewer overall courses, the dynamic programming approach may outperform the greedy strategy by finding a solution with fewer courses for different values of nn. The initially stated scenario erroneously suggested the greedy method was suboptimal; in reality, it provides an efficient path for n=15. However, for other values of n, especially those not directly examined here, the dynamic programming method could identify more course-efficient paths than a straightforward greedy approach by optimizing the sequence of jumps across the entire range to the target level."
