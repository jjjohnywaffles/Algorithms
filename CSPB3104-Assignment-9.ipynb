    "\n",
    "To compute the most likely spanning tree $T$ in the graph $G$, we can leverage Kruskal's algorithm with a modification to prioritize edges with higher weights, as the edge weights represent the likelihood of mutation. The weight of an edge between two nodes $(A_i, A_j)$ is $2^{-d(i,j)^2}$, where $d(i,j)$ is the number of differences between $A_i$ and $A_j$. The problem states that the mutation probability is proportional to $2^{-k^2}$, so an edge with fewer mutations (lower $d(i,j)$) will have a higher weight. This means the most likely mutations are those with minimal changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Represent the Graph**: First, represent the graph $G$ with nodes as the RNA sequences $A_1, \\ldots, A_n$ and edges between every pair of nodes. The edge weights are $2^{-d(i,j)^2}$, with $d(i,j)$ representing the number of differing positions between $A_i$ and $A_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sort the Edges**: Sort all edges of the graph $G$ in decreasing order of their weights. Since the weight represents the likelihood of mutation, sorting them this way ensures we prioritize mutations that are more likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize the Spanning Tree**: Start with an empty graph $T$ that will become the spanning tree. It contains all the vertices of $G$ but no edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Select the Edges**: Iterate through the sorted list of edges from step 2. For each edge, check if adding it to $T$ would create a cycle. If it does not create a cycle, add it to $T$. This can be efficiently done using a disjoint-set data structure (also known as a union-find data structure) to keep track of the components in $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create the Spanning Tree**: Continue adding edges until you have $n-1$ edges in $T$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$. Since $T$ is a tree, it must have exactly $n-1$ edges to be connected and acyclic.\n",

    "\n",
    "To show that the minimum weight partition crossing edge must belong to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) $T$, we can use a proof by contradiction. Assume that the minimum weight partition crossing edge, let's call it $e_{min}$ with vertices $(u, v)$ where $u \\in V_1$ and $v \\in V_2$, does not belong to the MST $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumption**: Assume that $e_{min}$ is not in the MST $T$. Since $T$ is a spanning tree, there exists at least one path in $T$ that connects $u$ and $v$. This path must consist of edges in $T$, which do not include $e_{min}$. Since $u$ and $v$ are in different clusters, $V_1$ and $V_2$, this path must cross the partition between $V_1$ and $V_2$ at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Existence of a Heavier Edge**: The path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$ that does not include $e_{min}$ must cross the partition between $V_1$ and $V_2$. Let's consider the first edge $e'$ on this path that crosses the partition. By our assumption, $e' \\neq e_{min}$, and since all edge weights are unique and $e_{min}$ is defined as the minimum weight partition crossing edge, the weight of $e'$ must be greater than the weight of $e_{min}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constructing a Cheaper Spanning Tree**: If we remove $e'$ from $T$ and add $e_{min}$ to it, we connect $V_1$ and $V_2$ while reducing the total weight of the tree, since the weight of $e_{min}$ is less than the weight of $e'$. This new tree is still spanning because it connects all vertices, and it is of lesser total weight than $T$, contradicting the assumption that $T$ is a Minimum Spanning Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contradiction**: This contradiction arises from our initial assumption that $e_{min}$ is not part of $T$. Therefore, the minimum weight partition crossing edge must indeed belong to the MST $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, by contradiction, we have shown that the minimum weight partition crossing edge between two clusters in a graph must belong to the Minimum Spanning Tree of that graph."
